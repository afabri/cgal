\ingroup PkgAABB_treeConcepts
\cgalConcept

The concept `AABBGeomTraits_2` defines the requirements for the first template parameter of the class `CGAL::AABB_traits<GeomTraits, Primitive>`. It provides predicates and constructors to detect and compute intersections between query objects and the primitives stored in the AABB tree. In addition, it contains predicates and constructors to compute distances between a point query and the primitives stored in the AABB tree.

\cgalHasModel Any Kernel is a model of this traits concept.

A functor object to detect intersections between two geometric objects.
Provides the operators:

where `Type_1` and `Type_2` are relevant types

Relevant herein means that a line primitive (ray, segment, line) is tested against a planar or solid primitive (plane, triangle, box), and a solid primitive is tested against another solid primitive (box against box). The operator returns `true` iff `type_1` and `type_2` have a non empty intersection.

A functor object to construct the intersection between two geometric objects.
This functor must support the result_of protocol, that is the return
type of the `operator()(A, B)` is `CGAL::cpp11::result<Intersect_2(A,B)>`.

Provides the operators:
`CGAL::cpp11::result<Intersect_2(A,B)> operator()(const A& a, const B& b);`
where `A` and `B` are any relevant types among `Ray_2`, `Segment_2`, `Line_2`,

Relevant herein means that a line primitive (ray, segment, line) is tested
against a planar or solid primitive (plane, triangle, box).
A model of `Kernel::Intersect_2` fulfills those requirements.
